# SPTSkeleton

This is a skeleton for iOS projects.


## Contents

* **CocoaPods support**: Really DRY `Podfile` and `PodSpec`
* **Common dependencies already included**:
	* `CocoaLumberjack`: Used for logging purpose (*Lorenzo should be happy now*).
	* `RBStoryboardLink`: Used for linking multiple storyboards.
  
  Of course you can customize them in the `PodSpec` file.
